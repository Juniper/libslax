/*

miss lucy had a baby
she named him tiny tim
she put him in the bathtub
to see if he could swim

he drank up all the water
he ate up all the soap
he tried to eat the bathtub
but is wouldn't go down his throat

miss lucy called the doctor
miss lucy called the nurse
miss lucy called the lady
with the alligator purse

mumps said the doctor
measles said the nurse
hiccups said the lady
with the alligator purse

out went the doctor
out went the nurse
out went the lady
with the alligator purse
